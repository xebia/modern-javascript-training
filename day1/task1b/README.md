# Task 1b: Changing to code to use new syntax

We're going to refactor the code a bit to use a few new syntax:

- Arrow functions
- `const` & `let`

## Task

0. Make sure you are in the right directory (`cd day1/task1b`).
1. Open `main.js` in your editor.
2. Change functions into arrow functions.
3. Change vars into const or lets (whichever you find applicable).
2. Open a terminal and change directory to the `task1b` folder.
3. Run `main.js` in Node.js by running `node main.js` in the terminal.

You'll know you've successfully run the script if this is printed:
```
You have completed Task #1
```
