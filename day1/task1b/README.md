# Task 1b: Changing to code to use new syntax

We're going to refactor the code a bit to use a few new syntax:

- Arrow functions
- Const & Let

## Task

1. Open `main.js` in your editor.
2. Change functions into arrow functions
3. Change vars into const or lets (which you find applicable)
2. Open a terminal and change directory to the `task1b` folder.
3. Run `main.js` in NodeJS by running `node main.js` in the terminal.

You'll know you've succesfully run the script if this is printed:
```
You have completed Task #1
```
