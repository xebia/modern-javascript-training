# Task 5: Unit testing JavaScript modules

We're going to be unit testing some modules using a test runner called 'Jest'.
There are many options when looking for a test runner / test framework.
Jest stands out for its scalability, great developer experience and powerful features.

## Task

0. Make sure you are in the right directory (`cd day1/task5`).
1. Install dependencies by `npm install`.
2. Run the test script defined in `package.json`.
3. Run the test script in watch mode (see tips).
4. Follow along with the intructions.

## Tips

You can add parameters to a defined npm script like so:
```
npm run test -- --watch
```

## Notes

1. watch mode
2. jasmine matchers (sum.test.js)
3. mocking (user.test.js)
4. mocking / spies & clearing (request.test.js)
5. snapshot testing (request.test.js)
6. coverage (.jestrc)
