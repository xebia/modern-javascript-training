# Task 2: Using what you've learned so far

We're going to use the following concepts:

- const
- object literals
- arrow functions
- template literal
- closures

## Task

Write an object factory function.
The object should contain a method `say` which will print the name of the object and a message given.

1. Open `main.js`
2. Finish the implementation of `personFactory`

You'll know you've succesfully run the script if this is printed:
```
Gert says: Hello!
Jan says: Hello!
You have completed Task #2
```
